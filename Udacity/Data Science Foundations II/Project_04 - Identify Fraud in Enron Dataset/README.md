# General Information

In 2000, Enron was one of the largest companies in the United States. Already in 2002, it collapsed and broke due to a fraud that involved much of the corporation. Resulting in a federal investigation, many data that is normally confidential, have become public, including tens of thousands of emails and financial details to executives of the highest levels of the company. In this project, I had to play the detective, and put my skills into building a predictive model that will determine whether or not an employee is an employee of interest (POI). An employee of concern is an employee who participated in the Enron scandal.
