My second (big) step in the Data Science world.

This course encompasses:

- SQL for data analysis
- Data Wrangling
- Statistics
- Introduction to Machine Learning

Each step has a big project that you can find in the folders.
`Intro Machine Learning` has many of Machine Learning mini projects, and you can find them on its folder as well.
