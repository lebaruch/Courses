# General Information

Machine Learning Course with a final Project

- Each folder has its own files with exercises and "mini projects"

- If you want to clone this folder and run the code in your environment, pay attention to the following steps:

1. The paths files in the code are considering my own environment. To works in your environment you have to change the code, or
save those files in the following path: D:\DataScience\Courses\Udacity\Data Science Foundations II\Intro Machine Learning

2. The enron e-mails database has too many files, so they are not in this repository. In order to unzip them, go to folder `tools` and run the file `startup.py`
It will check if the necessary libraries are installed, will download the emails and unzip them.

3. To check the final project, go to folder `final_project` and check the file `poi_id.py`
There is a report of the project, called `final_project_report`
