# General Information

In this project I have investigated the Chinook database. The Chinook database stores information about a music store. For this project, I should help the Chinook team understand the media in their store, customers and employees, and their billing information.

# Files

- `queries.txt`: queries used to achieve the results
- `Projeto - Chinook`: ppt and PDF versions of the project
- `chinook-db`: database used to gather information
