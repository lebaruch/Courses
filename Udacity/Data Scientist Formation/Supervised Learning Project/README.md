# General Information

In this project, I had to apply supervised learning techniques and analytical reasoning about the data collected by the United States Census to help CharityML (a fictitious charity) identify the people most likely to donate to their cause. 
First, I explored how the census data is recorded. Then I have applied a series of transformations and pre-processing techniques to manipulate the data and organize it into a format with which it can work. 
Then I had to evaluate various models of supervised learning of your choice over the data to determine which is best suited for the solution. 
After that, I did optimize the template I have selected and present it as your solution for CharityML. 
Finally, I did explore the chosen model and its predictions from underneath the cloths to evaluate its performance considering the data available.
